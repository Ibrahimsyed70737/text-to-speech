# RadicalSpeak - Text-to-Speech Website

---

## üöÄ Overview

RadicalSpeak is a stylish and functional web application that transforms your text into speech with a "classically radical" aesthetic. It leverages your browser's native text-to-speech capabilities, allowing you to select different voices (male and female, if available on your system), adjust speech speed, and modify pitch.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Convert any typed text into spoken words.
* **Voice Selection:** Choose from a list of available voices on your system, with an emphasis on readily accessible male and female options.
* **Speed Control:** Adjust the playback speed (`rate`) of the spoken text.
* **Pitch Control:** Modify the tone or `pitch` of the voice.
* **Stop Functionality:** Immediately halt ongoing speech playback.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
* **"Classically Radical" UI:** A unique visual design combining elegant typography with bold, contrasting colors and subtle, edgy elements.

## üé® Design Philosophy

The "Classically Radical" design aims to blend timeless elegance with a bold, unconventional flair. This is achieved through:

* **Font Pairing:** Utilizing `Playfair Display` for impactful headings and `Roboto Mono` for a modern, code-inspired touch in body text and controls.
* **Vibrant Color Palette:** A dark primary background contrasted with a striking red (`#FF6B6B`) and a cool teal (`#4ECDC4`) for accent and secondary elements.
* **Distinct Shadows:** An offset box-shadow effect gives UI elements a dynamic, almost three-dimensional appearance.
* **Geometric Accents:** Subtle pseudo-elements create angular, radical border details on the main container.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the web page.
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and implementing the "classically radical" design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers the text-to-speech functionality using the native **Web Speech API**.
